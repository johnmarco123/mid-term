The design of my snooker application was based upon the picture provided.
I tried to make an exact replica of the picture provided whilst also
following the dimensions required for the assignment. 

For the functionality of the cue i decided to use the arrow keys. I found that
using the arrows keys made the game easier to play whilst also providing a bit
more challenge as it is harder to aim using arrow keys then it would be with
the mouse. This may seem counter-intuitive, but since I added a hit indicator, 
i wanted to make the pool game a bit harder to balance that feature. When
placing the cue ball in the d-zone i decided to use mouse interaction as I
found it is the most self explanitory and it is the easiest for users to
understand. 

In my unique extension, I have implemented a custom game mode, activated when
the user clicks the number 4. This mode features the standard snooker ball
arrangement, but with 6 portals scattered across the pool table. When a ball
enters a portal, it emerges from the corresponding portal on the opposite end.
This twist to the traditional snooker game, only achievable through video game
technology, adds an extra level of excitement and interest.

The inspiration behind my idea came from the video game "Portal 2" where the
user can jump through a portal and appear through the side of another portal.
The implamentation behind this was quite straightforward, as the velocity when
the ball hits the portal is carried when i teleport it to its new location.
